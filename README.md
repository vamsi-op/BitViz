*BitHub - Where bits come to life!*

## 📖 How to Use

### 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Open the visualizer** - Open `index.html` in your browser
2. **Enter numbers** - Use the input fields at the top to enter two numbers (default: 10 and 6)
3. **Watch the magic** - All bitwise operations update automatically in real-time!

## 🛠️ Main Features

### 1️⃣ **Binary Display (Top Section)**
- Shows the 32-bit binary representation of your numbers
- Updates instantly as you type
- Grouped in 4-bit chunks for readability

**Example:**
```
Number 1: 10  → 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001010
Number 2: 6   → 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000110
```

### 2️⃣ **Bitwise Operations (6 Cards)**

#### **AND Operation (&)**
- Returns 1 only if BOTH bits are 1
- **Example:** `10 & 6 = 2`
- Binary: `1010 & 0110 = 0010`

#### **OR Operation (|)**
- Returns 1 if ANY bit is 1
- **Example:** `10 | 6 = 14`
- Binary: `1010 | 0110 = 1110`

#### **XOR Operation (^)**
- Returns 1 if bits are DIFFERENT
- **Example:** `10 ^ 6 = 12`
- Binary: `1010 ^ 0110 = 1100`

#### **NOT Operation (~)**
- Flips all bits (0→1, 1→0)
- **Example:** `~10 = -11`
- Uses two's complement for negative numbers

#### **Left Shift (<<)**
- Shifts bits left, fills with 0
- Multiplies by 2^n
- **Example:** `10 << 2 = 40` (multiply by 4)
- Adjust shift amount with the input field

#### **Right Shift (>>)**
- Shifts bits right
- Divides by 2^n
- **Example:** `10 >> 2 = 2` (divide by 4)
- Adjust shift amount with the input field

## 💡 Tips for Learning

### **Visual Learning**
- Watch how bits change color when they're 1
- Green highlights show the result bits
- Pay attention to bit patterns in different operations

### **Experiment**
- Try different number combinations
- Use powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.)
- Test negative numbers to see two's complement

### **Common Patterns**
- **Even/Odd check:** `n & 1` (if 0, even; if 1, odd)
- **Multiply by 2:** `n << 1`
- **Divide by 2:** `n >> 1`
- **Clear lowest set bit:** `n & (n-1)`

---

## 🎨 Understanding the Colors

- **White text on dark**: Regular bits (0s)
- **Green highlight**: Result bits that are 1
- **Green accent**: Primary color for success/set bits
- **Red**: Errors or bits that are 0

## 🔥 Quick Examples to Try

### Example 1: Finding Powers of 2
```
Number 1: 16
Click "Check if Power of 2" → ✓ Is a power of 2
Explanation: 16 & 15 = 0 (10000 & 01111 = 00000)
```

### Example 2: XOR Swap
```
Number 1: 5
Number 2: 7
Click "Swap Two Numbers" → Shows a=7, b=5
No temporary variable needed!
```

### Example 3: Set a Bit
```
Number 1: 10 (binary: 1010)
Position: 0
Click "Set nth Bit" → Result: 11 (binary: 1011)
```

## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with small numbers (0-15) to easily see bit patterns
2. **Use Powers of 2** - Numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 have single set bits
3. **Watch Patterns** - Notice how AND filters, OR combines, XOR finds differences
4. **Practice Daily** - Try one LeetCode problem using bit manipulation daily
5. **Test Edge Cases** - Try 0, -1, maximum integers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Binary display not updating?**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Operations showing wrong results?**
- Make sure you're using valid 32-bit integers
- Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

**Animations too fast/slow?**
- Animations are optimized for smooth learning
- They trigger when values change
